## Description of the app

The purpose of Life Log is to increase the communication between the seniors and their family members to let them maintain strong ties with their beloved ones. The purpose of the app content is to enable its users to remember information about their family members, share a wishlist, see each otherâ€™s photos, and take notes about their lives. Although there are many social media platforms to interact with the whole world, this app focuses on the privacy of families by letting them share information, photos, or videos only with their families, especially with their parents or grandparents in nursing homes. Life Log users include people whose parents or grandparents live in a nursing home. The audience consists of two groups of people:

- Seniors who want to receive information or pictures from their families.
- Younger people who want to share more of their life with their elderly relatives.

Both groups want to be more connected with their families. Although there is a gap between generations, all users can use basic applications on a tablet or a smartphone. The Life Log interface will be very simple and user-friendly, which will allow any users even with very limited technology to use this web-based app.
